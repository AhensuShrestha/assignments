#Average: Arithmetic mean (Average) is the sum of data divided by the number of data-points. It is a measure of the central location of data in a set of values which vary in range.
#Uses: Averages are used to summarize data and provide a simple measure of central tendency.
def compute_mean(data):
    """Compute the mean of a list of numbers."""

#Variance: variance is the squared deviation of a variable from its mean. Basically, it measures the spread of random data in a set from its mean or median value.
#Uses: Variance is used to quantify the dispersion or spread of data points.
def compute_variance(data):
    """Compute the variance of a list of numbers."""
    return np.var(data, ddof=1)

#Covariance: Covariance provides the measure of strength of correlation between two variable or more set of variables. 
#Uses: Covariance is used to determine the relationship between two variables. Itâ€™s a key component in statistical models and risk assessment.

#Gaussian distribution: Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution function which is symmetric about its mean and has a bell-shaped curve. It is one of the most used probability distributions.
#Uses: The Gaussian distribution is widely used in statistics to model real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.
